Approaching Zaydi Marriage Networks 740-860: Endogamy, Exogamy and Concubinage

Prosopographical approaches to early Islamic studies, have, in recent years identified genealogical or Ansāb material as a highly fruitful means to explore and understand the social history of Early Islam. These studies by scholars such as Ahmed, Bernheimer, Majied Robinson and Elizabeth Urban amongst others have established a few key tenets. First of all, there is a clear shift towards concubinage by the third generation after the death of the prophet Muhammad, i.e., by the 60s/680s. Secondly, endogamous unions, in other words, marrying within the same family becomes increasingly common for elites of the Islamic empire - who are of course, the subjects of our historical sources. Thirdly, exogamy or marrying outside of the family becomes less common, despite serving an extremely important political purpose to tie families together. These are conclusions reached by all of the scholars mentioned above, however, these studies have tended to focus primarily on either the contents of one source (Urban and Robinson) or across sources and on a specific line of descent (the Alids for Bernheimer, five companion families of the Prophet). However, in what follows I would like to combine the approach and look specifically at how the descendants of Zayd b. 'Alī are preserved in two sources, al-ʿAqīqī's Kitāb al-Muʿaqqibīn - the earliest genealogy of the Ṭālibid family and al-Zubayrī's Nasab Quraysh. These two genealogists were contemporaneous to one another and both resided in Mecca, reflecting the burgeoning genealogical tradition of the mid ninth century. I hope that comparing these two sources will inform our understanding not only of Zaydi family ties but also the agenda and limitations of these sources.

I will primarily focus on al-'Aqiqi in the following pages as I am currently finishing to collate the database of this work, which I will employ for larger network analysis questions. The scope of my research here is therefore, two-fold, on the one hand I wish to explore Zaydi Marriage Networks and provide an overview of them as they are preserved in the Kitab al-Muʿaqqibīn and the other is to test my approach to structuring and analysing the data. I look forward to feedback on both. Attached you will find also the pages of al-ʿAqīqī concerned with the descendants of Zayd b. ʿAlī, they are very terse reading but lend themselves very well to data-driven approaches.

How to use this document and the data tables

I have opted to share this document in HTML format rather than a traditional PDF as otherwise I would have to share a substantial amount of excel spreadsheets etc, which would interrupt the flow of the analysis. Furthermore, it has the additional benefit of being easily updatable and public (a new version could simply replace this one via GitHub). I would be quite keen to get feedback also on your experience working and reading it in this format.One benefit of this approach is that it also provides a glimpse into the approach I have taken to data collection and organisation, however, I do recognise this may be confusing at first, therefore, a few aspects need to be addressed. Firstly, I have structured the data around generations (an approach previously adopted by Robinson and Urban), Generation 1 is ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib, Generation 2 are his sons, so on and so forth. Secondly, I have assigned individual IDs to each individual as this allows me to distinguish easily between the numerous repeating names in the text, it will suprise many of you to know that the ʿAlids were commonly named al-Huṣayn or al-Ḥasan. Thirdly, I have followed the text in viewing Umm Walads (child-bearing concubines) as distinct when they are included in separate clauses, I am not sure this reflects a historical reality or not, but given that al-ʿAqīqī does not group them together I have maintained his methodology. Having established my methodology it is appropriate to return to the source material.

Yahyā b. al-Ḥasan al-ʿAqīqī (214-77/829-91)

A brief introduction of the author is necessary, al-ʿAqīqī was a descendant of the fourth Imami Imām, Alī Zayn al-ʿAbidīn – his full nasab is Yaḥyā b. al-Ḥasan b. Jaʿfar b. ʿUbayd Allāh b. al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī b. al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib named al-ʿAqīqī because of being born near the wadī al-ʿAqīq in Medina. He lived most of his life in Medina, with The manuscript containing the Kitāb al Muʿaqqibīn is a unicum in the Daiber collection in Tokyo (MS. 127). The text was edited from photocopies provided by Kazuo Morimoto to the Marʿashi Library in Qom. No study of the text is known to me, the closest we have is an article by Lucia Veccia Vaglieri, in which she used the source to investigate Alid female names. It has, additionally, been used by Morimoto in his study on the development of Shi’i genealogy and by Bernheimer in her study of Alid genealogy. As summarised by Morimoto, al-ʿAqīqī was known – by the sixth/thirteenth century – as the first to write a genealogy of the Ṭālibid families, the now lost Kitāb Ansāb Āl ʿAbī Ṭālib, which was transmitted by his sons and used by al-Masʿūdī and al-Iṣfahānī in their Murūj al-Dhahāb and Kitāb al-Maqātil al-Ṭālibiyyīn respectively. The Muʿaqqibīn appears to be an abridged version of this, but a dedicated study is needed, which I am hoping to be able to conduct.

The text is structured by the ʿAqīb or descendants of a single Ṭālibid and then follows his line of descendants to then return back to the brother of the first subject. In practice this mean it covers ʿAlī himself, then Ḥasan and the Ḥasanid line, then Ḥusayn and the Ḥusaynid line so on and so forth. It seems to reflect primogeniture, i.e., starting with the first-born son, however, it substantially omits a number of historical figures and marriages to and with the Umayyad or Abbasid families, in fact, it is worth pointing out that if we were to follow only al-ʿAqīqī, we would conclude that the Alids were nearly exclusively endogamous. Furthermore, unlike other ansāb works of the period, al-ʿAqīqī does not list female descendants, perhaps because they did tend to marry outside of the family in the early period. When he provides the mother, he provides her name (sometimes as a kunya) and her nasab, typically they are an Alid themselves, a descendat of a companion of the prophet or at the very least a descendant of another branch of Abū Ṭāib. As an author, therefore, he does demonstrate an identifiable agenda. However, these absences are particularly illustrative, is it due to a “shame” associated with Alid exogamy at the end of the ninth century, an active attempt at redrawing the boundaries of Alid identity, or perhaps it was practical, genealogical texts – as pointed out by Morimoto – eventually become “forward-looking,” i.e., their purpose is not recount a historical genealogical past but rather ratify and confirm the genealogies of individuals laying claim to them.

The following tables and graphs are a product of the data collection process I have conducted using the Muʿaqqibīn, these are still preliminary and there may be mistakes in the data processing as well as in the collection. I will point these out where necessary.

So, first of all there are 28 Zaydi fathers in the dataset, this is compared to 27 in the Nasab Quraysh. If you sort the table by total_children you find that the Zaydi with the most descendants is Yaḥya b. al-Ḥusayn b. Zayd, the grandson of Zayd b. ʿAlī who rebelled with his cousing Muḥammad Nafs al-Zakiyya in 780, he was also allegedly raised by the Imām Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq.

{r, echo=FALSE}
Zaydi_Marriage_Lite <- read.csv("/Users/leo/Desktop/ACADEMIA/IMBOD/AKM_R/data/data_processed/Zaydi_Marriage_Lite.csv")
Zaydi_Marriage_Lite <- Zaydi_Marriage_Lite[, -1]
reactable(Zaydi_Marriage_Lite, searchable = TRUE, pagination = TRUE)


According to al-ʿAqīqī he had each of these children with a different woman, only, one, however, was not born to a concubine, Aḥmad. His mother was Safiyya bt. Mūsā b. ʿUmar b. ʿAlī b. al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī, a second cousin of the same generation as Yahyā. Yahyā’s father appears as the next one with the most children, six.

What about breaking it down by generation, what is the most populous generation of the Zaydis and how does this compare to the Talibids generally?

Firstly, lets assess Zaydi Marriage by generations.

{r, echo=FALSE}
Zaydi_Marriage_Stats <- read.csv("/Users/leo/Desktop/ACADEMIA/IMBOD/AKM_R/data/data_processed/Zaydi_Marriage_Stats.csv")
Zaydi_Marriage_Stats <- Zaydi_Marriage_Stats[, -1]
Zaydi_Marriage_Stats <- Zaydi_Marriage_Stats[, -5]
reactable(Zaydi_Marriage_Stats, searchable = TRUE, pagination = TRUE)

As is clear in the table, the most populous generation of the Zaydis is generation 8, the same as the 9th Imam Muhammad al-Jawad (b. 195/811 - d. 220/835), so a generation born and coming of age between the second and third Hijri centuries. Notably, however, the generation with the most concubine mothers is generation 6 which is equivalent to Majied Robinson's generation 10 for which he calculated that 28% of all mothers in the Nasab Quraysh were concubines. In the Muʿaqqibīn, for the Zaydis it is 66%, with a much smaller sample size so I would not read too much into it. However, Robinson has demonstrated that Concubine-born children had difficulties on the marriage market, perhaps the higher rate of concubinage amongst the Zaydis, who themselves descend from a concubine, may have contributed. What about the Ṭālibids as a whole though?

{r, echo=FALSE}
AKM_Marriage_Stats <- read.csv("/Users/leo/Desktop/ACADEMIA/IMBOD/AKM_R/data/data_processed/AKM_Marriage_Stats.csv")
AKM_Marriage_Stats <- AKM_Marriage_Stats[, -1]
reactable(AKM_Marriage_Stats, searchable = TRUE, pagination = TRUE)

As is visible in the table for the Talibids as a whole, the largest generation is generation 7 – generation 1 is ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib – the same generation as the 8th Imam Ali al-Rida (b. 148/765 - d. 202/818) , so the first generation we should firmly expect to have been born in the ʿAbbāsid period. While for the Zaydis it is the subsequent generation, generation 8, so the great-grandchildren of Zayd b. ʿAlī himself. In fact, while my data collation is not 100% complete of the Muʿaqqibīn, (it is of descendants of Hasan and Husayn, but not the other sons of ʿAlī). Zayd’s great-grandchildren (generation 8) are over half of the recorded children of that generation. Curious to know whether this is a product of the material, to me it is striking that despite the very frequent Zaydī rebellions of the end of the eighth-ninth century, that they are such a large cohort in the Muʿaqqibīn. Significantly it is again generation 6 that sees the highest rate of concubiange - I plan to assess the Alid data in the Nasab Quraysh to determine whether this is merely a feature of the Muʿaqqibīn or a feature of the wider Ṭālibid family. Bernheimer in her own analysis of Alid marriage patterns points out that the growing rates of concubinage (particularly amongst the Ḥusaynids) is an indication of the growing perception of the Alids as the first-family of Islam. This means its worth checking the rates of endogamy and exogamy of the Zaydis in the Muʿaqqibīn.

{r, echo=FALSE}
endogamy_exogamy <- read.csv("/Users/leo/Desktop/ACADEMIA/IMBOD/AKM_R/data/data_processed/Zaydi_endogamy_exogamy.csv")
endogamy_exogamy <- endogamy_exogamy[, -1]
reactable(endogamy_exogamy, searchable = TRUE, pagination = TRUE)

As you can see, exogamous marriages are actually more common than endogamous for the Zaydi dataset, however, concubinage outstrips both.

{r, echo=FALSE}
Zaydi_endogamy_count <- read_csv("/Users/leo/Desktop/ACADEMIA/IMBOD/AKM_R/data/data_processed/total_endogamy.csv")
Zaydi_endogamy_count <- Zaydi_endogamy_count[, -1]
reactable(Zaydi_endogamy_count)

There are many more things that can be conducted with this data, especially when applying to a larger dataset or bringing into comparison with other sources, which will be my next steps.

Tables are not the only possible output of this approach we can also begin to visualise interactive networks of marriage as this one below.

{r, echo = FALSE}

library(visNetwork)

nodes <- read.csv("/Users/leo/Desktop/ACADEMIA/IMBOD/AKM_R/nodes.csv")
edges <- read.csv("/Users/leo/Desktop/ACADEMIA/IMBOD/AKM_R/edges.csv")

# Visualize with hierarchical layout
# Use hierarchical layout
visNetwork(nodes, edges, width = "100%", height = "1200px", main = "Descendants of Zayd b. Ali") %>%
  visEdges(arrows = list(to = list(enabled = TRUE, scaleFactor = 0.5))) %>%
  visOptions(
    highlightNearest = TRUE,
    selectedBy = "label") %>% 
  visNodes(
    size = 10, 
    font = list(size = 12),
    label = nodes$label,
    labelHighlightBold = TRUE,
    color = list(background = nodes$color, border = "black")
  ) %>%
  visLayout(
    hierarchical = TRUE,  # Set hierarchical layout to TRUE
  ) %>%
  visHierarchicalLayout(
    direction = "UD",     # Up-Down orientation; for Left-Right use "LR"
    levelSeparation = 150,  # Distance between levels
    nodeSpacing = 250,      # Spacing between nodes on the same level
    treeSpacing = 200,      # Space between branches
    blockShifting = NULL,   # Avoid overlapping blocks
    edgeMinimization = TRUE, # Reduce edge crossings
    shakeTowards = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  visPhysics(
    enabled = TRUE,
    solver = "hierarchicalRepulsion", 
    hierarchicalRepulsion = list(
      nodeDistance = 200,      # Distance between nodes
      springLength = 200,      # Edge spring length
      springConstant = 0.05,   # Spring stiffness
      damping = 1           # Damping to reduce shakiness
    ),
    stabilization = list(
      enabled = TRUE,
      iterations = 1000,
      fit = TRUE  # Automatically adjust view
    )
  ) %>%
  visInteraction(
    tooltipDelay = 200,  # Delay for tooltips
    hideEdgesOnDrag = TRUE,  # Hide edges when dragging
    hover = TRUE,  # Enable hover effects
    selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,  # Highlight edges connected to selected node
    dragView = TRUE,
    navigationButtons = TRUE,
    multiselect = TRUE
  )


Overall, my goal is to begin to generate a clear methodology and approach for creating genealogical netowrks that can serve to explore and build on the substantial work that has already been done on early islamic social history and begin to map the communities preserved in the source material. There are numerous potential benefits, including, hopefully the generation of teaching tools and materials that foreground bilateral kinship ties.

 What about to the other sons of the 4th Imam??

Does the trend of concubinage match with the findings of Robinson?
